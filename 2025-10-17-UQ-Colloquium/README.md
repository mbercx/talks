- **Where**: University of Queensland

## Abstract

Reproducibility is a core tenet of science, yet many published results cannot be reproduced—eroding trust and wasting valuable time. Even within research groups, new students routinely spend days or months trying to re-create prior results. This talk introduces AiiDA, a scientific workflow manager rooted in condensed-matter theory and, more recently, used to drive experimental work. I will show how AiiDA’s history (provenance) tracking, automation, and robust workflows aim to address common failure points in reproducibility, with concrete examples from real projects. I will also demonstrate how AiiDAlab—a Jupyter-based framework—turns these workflows into accessible GUI applications, lowering the barrier for non-experts. Finally, I will discuss software development in science more broadly: the issues it has, how these tie into the reproducibility problem, and some personal thoughts on what can be done about it.
